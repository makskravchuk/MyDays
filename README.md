# MyDays
  MyDays is a web application for keeping a personal diary. With this application, users can create records of their days, add photos, videos, voice messages, mark their mood and health status, reflect their achievements, life lessons and feelings, and much more.
  
  Users can track their life journey using the calendar and find entries through search. The app will help users find common moments with friends, open up new perspectives, and distribute access to their days according to configured privacy levels. Day search functionality, statistics, and reports on moods and days allow users to analyse their lives from different angles.
  
  In addition, MyDays has a deeper meaning - it is a tool for preserving history and heritage. In the future, your descendants and family will have access to this digital archive, allowing them to preserve and pass on your memories to future generations. In this way, MyDays helps connect your past with the future and preserve your valuable heritage.
